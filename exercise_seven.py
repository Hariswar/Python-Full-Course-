#Exercise 7: 
response = input("Would you like to have some food? (Y/N): ")

if response == "Y": #You don't use = operator since its assignes to a value but in this case we use comparison operator(==) to check whether two values are equal. 
  print("Have some food!")
else: 
  print("No food for you!")
